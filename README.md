## Author: Imran Shaikh

This repo includes solutions to 4 basic coding problems written in **JavaScript**. Each file contains a self-contained script with sample input/output.

## Files Overview

###  `Problem-1.js` – Calculator (Using Class)
A simple class-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

It takes in two numbers (`a`, `b`) and a string specifying the operation (`'add'`, `'substract'`, `'multiply'`, `'divide'`).

---

###  `Problem-2.js` – Generate Odd Series
Takes a single number `a` as input and prints the first `a` odd numbers starting from 1.

**Example:**
- Input: `3`
- Output: `1, 3, 5`

---

###  `Problem-3.js` – Conditional Odd Series
This one builds on Problem-2, but with a twist:
- If `a` is **odd**, print first `a` odd numbers
- If `a` is **even**, print first `a - 1` odd numbers

**Example:**
- Input: `4`
- Output: `1, 3, 5`

---

###  `Problem-4.js` – Count Multiples in an Array
Given an array of numbers, this script checks how many of them are divisible by each number from 1 to 9.

**Example Input:**
```js
[1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30]
